# Krita and GIMP

Although image generation AI is becoming popular, I am becoming interested in hand drawing to enjoy being human.

## Krita

### Non-AI-generated 2D art with Wacom One

(Work in progress)

I visited Tokyo Disney Sea this summer, and I took a lot of pictures there. Let's make line arts from a few of those pictures, and color them.

### AI-generated Coloring Books

I used AUTOMATIC1111/StableDiffusion to generate a French town line art in Edouard Manet's style, then used Krita with Wacom One for coloring. This drawing is not so interesting, just an experiment.

I have got that Krita can generate normal maps as well.
